# This is the main configuration file for the application.

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
#
# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.
#
# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
play.i18n.langs = [ "en" ]

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.username=sa
# db.default.password=""

slick.dbs.default.db.user="sa"
slick.dbs.default.db.password="12345"
slick.dbs.default.db.numThreads=5

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# play.evolutions.enabled=false

# You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
# play.evolutions.db.default.enabled=false

# Mailers
# ~~~~~
play.mailer {
  host = smtp.gmail.com
  port = 465
  ssl = true
  tls = true
  user = "mail@address.com" #Config your username
  password = "abczyz" #Config your password
  #  debug (defaults to no, to take effect you also need to set the log level to "DEBUG" for the application logger)
  #  timeout (defaults to 60s in milliseconds)
  #  connectiontimeout (defaults to 60s in milliseconds)
  #  mock (defaults to no, will only log all the email properties instead of sending an email)
